    <h1 id="head">🌙 Eid ul Azha – A Festival of Sacrifice, Gratitude, and Generosity</h1>
    <p>As the crescent moon is sighted and the call of Eid ul Azha echoes through our hearts, millions of Muslims across the globe prepare to celebrate one of the most spiritually significant days in the Islamic calendar. Also known as Eid al-Adha or the Festival of Sacrifice, this day honors the unwavering faith and obedience of Prophet Ibrahim (A.S).</p>
    <h4>🕋 The Story Behind the Sacrifice</h4>
    <p>At the heart of Eid ul Azha lies the powerful story of Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.), who was commanded by Allah to sacrifice his beloved son, Ismail (A.S.), as a test of his faith. Just as he was about to fulfill this divine command, Allah replaced Ismail with a ram—signifying that it’s not the blood or meat that reaches Allah, but the sincerity and devotion behind the act.</p>
    <h4>🐐 The Essence of Qurbani</h4>
    <p>Qurbani, or the ritual animal sacrifice, symbolizes submission to Allah’s will and a reminder to detach ourselves from worldly attachments. The meat is divided into three parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One-third for the family,</li>
        <li>One-third for relatives and friends,</li>
        <li>And one-third for the needy and poor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This act reflects not just sacrifice, but sharing, empathy, and compassion—values that Islam places at the core of a peaceful society.</p>
    <h4>🕌 The Spirit of Togetherness</h4>
    <p>Eid ul Azha is more than just a religious duty. It’s a time when families come together, mosques overflow with worshippers, and kitchens are filled with the aroma of freshly cooked meals. It’s a day of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gratitude for our blessings,</li>
        <li>Unity among the Ummah, and</li>
        <li>Helping those less fortunate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether it’s through distributing meat, inviting neighbors for a meal, or donating to charity, this Eid encourages us to extend our hands beyond our homes.</p>
    <h4>✨ A Reminder for the Soul</h4>
    <p>In a world full of distractions and desires, Eid ul Azha serves as a gentle reminder that true success lies in obedience to Allah, sacrifice for others, and contentment in what we have.</p>
    <p>Let’s make this Eid not just a celebration, but a turning point—to give more, love deeper, and live with purpose.</p>
