        Pakistan</h1>
    <h3 align="center">India defeat Green Shirts by 6 wickets; Kohli gets century; Pakistan needed to set target of at
        least 270 for a fighting chance, but they set 242.</h3>
    <p align="center">India defeated Pakistan by six wickets in a one-sided encounter at the Champions Trophy match
        between the two
        arch-rivals in Dubai on Sunday.</p>
    <p align="center"><b>Match summary by Mir Shabbar Ali:</b> After the start India got, it was perfectly set for Virat
        Kohli to do his thing. He put up great partnerships with Shubman Gill first and then Shreyas Iyer and set things
        up nicely for not only India’s win but his fourth ODI century against Pakistan as well to give the Indian fans
        yet another memory to cherish from the high-octane fixture.</p>

        <h2>Over 43 — Ind</h2>
        <p>The Indian great finished the game in the next over, smashing Khushdil over for a boundary and bringing up
            his century, simultaneously winning the game for India. Typical of the great man. The Indian side looked
            considerably more comfortable today, especially their star batter as the Blue Team won by six wickets.</p>
        <p>Kohli’s century, courtesy ESPN Cricinfo: Virat Kohli has shown he’s still got it, that maybe, just maybe, the
            little he’s lost wasn’t going to define him. He ticked off 14,000 runs in ODI cricket, brought up his 51st
            ODI century, set up India for a semi-final spot and essentially crossed out Pakistan from the 2025 Champions
            Trophy.</p>

        <h2>Over 40 — Ind - 223/4</h2>
        <p>Shaheen was welcomed onto the crease by Hardik Pandya with a boundary, who danced down the crease and
            dispatched the pacer over cover with disdain. The pacer dismissed the all-rounder on the last ball of the
            over, bringing the Indian chase to 223 for the loss of four wickets after forty overs.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Over 39 — Ind - 215/3</h2>
        <p>Khushdil replaced Abrar, who had completed his quota for the day. Iyer continued with the attack and
            dispatched the spinner over his head for a boundary. However, he was dismissed by the off-spinner on the
            next delivery after Imam caught a blinder at cover. Six runs came from it as India’s chase reached 215 for
            the loss of three wickets.</p>
        <p>“How can you take a catch like that when you’ve dropped sitters like Pakistan have all day,” Alex Hartley,
            former England bowler, on BBC Radio 5 Sports.</p>

        <h3>Over 38 — Ind - 209/2</h3>
        <p>Haris continued with his seventh over as it became painful to watch, the inevitability of another humbling
            awaited the Pakistan team. Eight runs came off the 38th over as India’s chase reached 209 for the loss of
            two wickets.</p>
        <p>“Virat Kohli can get to 100 here. That’s almost the last bit of interest in this game,” Daniel Norcross,
            special commentator, on BBC Radio 5 Sports.</p>

        <h3>Over 37 — Ind - 201/2</h3>
        <p>Iyer completed his fifty in the 37th over by Abrar. A wonderful innings from the batter who stuck around
            beside the Indian great after the Blue Team lost early wickets. Only a single from it brings India’s chase
            to 201 for the loss of two wickets.</p>
        <p><b>Iyer’s 50:</b> According to ESPN Cricinfo, it really is a walk in the park. No more question marks.

            <p>Haris replaced Naseem and was pulled by Kohli on one knee for a boundary on the fifth delivery of the
                over. 11 runs came from the 36th over with India requiring 42 runs on 82 balls to win.</p>
        </figcaption>
        <p>Why did the Pakistani batsman bring a snorkel to the match?
            Because with that sinking score, he figured he’d be diving into the deep end!</p>
        <p>“You’re not going to win a tournament in the subcontinent with one spinner. They knew what the conditions
            were going to be like and they haven’t picked the right team.</p>
        <p>Pakistan have just been pedestrian today,“ reiterated Ramiz Raja on BBC.</p>

        <h2>Over 35 — Ind - 189/2</h2>
        <p>Abrar bowled his ninth over of the innings and conceded four runs, bringing India’s chase to 189 for the loss

        <h2>Over 34 — Ind - 185/2</h2>
        <p>Naseem was brought back into the attack for the 34th over and not a lot changed for the Indian side as they
            comfortably trodded along against what was now seeming to be an excellent batting pitch. Six runs came from
            it as India’s chase reached 185 for the loss of two wickets.</p>
        <p>ESPN Cricinfo: Both Kohli and Iyer are starting to play their shots now. They aren’t afraid of what would
            happen if one of their risks don’t come off because a) they have batting depth and b) this chase is almost
            done.</p>
        <p>“What was strange is how the squad was selected by Pakistan. Just the one spinner,” Ramiz Raja on BBC Radio 5
            Sports.</p>

        </p>
        <p>And now the vuvuzelas are out. That annoying sound was once the bane of football fans in the World Cup. It
            now rings in Pakistan’s defeat at the hands of India.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Over 33 — Ind - 179/2</h2>
        <p>Abrar was brought back into the attack by Rizwan in the 33rd over, giving away four runs in his eighth over.
            Indian batters were comfortable with rotating the strike against the spinner, bringing the Indian chase to
            179 for the loss of two wickets.</p>

        <h2>Over 32 — Ind - 175/2</h2>
        <p>Abrar is back into the attack, but has Rizwan waited too long to reintroduce him into the attack? It
            certainly seems so at this point.

            Khushdil was also introduced with a boundary between point and cover by Iyer who continued his onslaught. A
            double and a single ends the 32nd over adding seven runs to India’s chase which was at 175 for two after the
            loss of two wickets.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Over 31 — Ind - 168/2</h2>
        <p>Salman Ali Agha was brought into the attack by the Pakistani skipper and was lofted over the mid-wicket
            boundary as the Indian batters started toying around with the bowlers. Two singles from it end the 31st
            over. bringing India’s chase to 168 for the loss of two wickets.</p>

        <h2>Over 30 — Ind - 160/2</h2>
        <p>According to BBC, Virat Kohli averages 55.69 against Pakistan in ODIs. No India player with 500 plus runs in
            the format against Pakistan averages more.</p>
        <p>It’s men against boys at the moment as Iyer dispatched Khushdil for two boundaries before he chipped it just
            above Saud who couldn’t jump high enough to grab it. Another missed opportunity for Pakistan as 10 runs come
            from the 30th over to bring the chase to 160 for the loss of two wickets.</p>

        <h2>Over 29 — Ind - 150/2</h2>
        <p>Shaheen was welcomed back into the attack by Kohli who walked out of the crease, chipping the ball over
            mid-on for a boundary. Two doubles and two singles from the 29th over bring the Indian chase to 150 for the
            loss of two wickets.

            A seemingly content calm has settled on the stadium as even the Indian fans seem to know the end is nigh.

            “This is pretty pedestrian from Pakistan. They need to have the want to win,” Ramiz Raja on BBC Radio 5
            Sports.</p>

        <p>
            <center>Analysis by Dawn sports <br> correspondent Mir Shabbar Ali: We don’t have <br>
                enough runs to defend so probably that’s why <br>Rizwan hasn’t gone for an attacking field.</center>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Over 28 — Ind - 140/2</h2>
        <p>Khushdil continued with what seems like a walk in the park for the Blue Team as they kept the scoreboard ticking, adding four runs to the Indian total in the 28th over, taking the chase to 140 for the loss of two wickets.</p>
        <p>“You look at Virat Kohli and you know why he’s such a great player. It’s the big shots followed by a single followed by reading the situation, rising to the situation. He’s not cocky or selfish either. He does what’s best for the team.</p>
        <p>Playing Pakistan is all about controlling your nerves and he does it perfectly. It takes another kind of mental high to successfully chase like he does,“ former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja on BBC.</p>
