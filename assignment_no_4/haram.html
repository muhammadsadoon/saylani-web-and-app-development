    <h1><u>Masjid al-Haram</u></h1>
    <p>Masjid al-Haram (Arabic:<b> ٱَلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْحَرَام</b>, romanized: al-Masjid al-Ḥarām, lit.'The Sacred Mosque'),also known as the Sacred Mosque or the Great Mosque of Mecca, is considered to be the most significant mosque in Islam.It encloses the vicinity of the Kaaba in Mecca, in the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia. It is among the pilgrimage sites associated with the Hajj, which every Muslim must perform at least once in their lives if able. It is also the main site for the performance of ʿUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, such as the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim,</p><br><br><br>
    <h3>History</h3><hr>
    <p>The Great Mosque contends with the Masjid As-Sahabah in the Eritrean city of Massawa and Quba Mosque in Medina as the oldest mosque. According to Islamic tradition, Islam as a religion precedes Muhammad representing previous prophets such as Abraham. According to Islamic scholars, Abraham is seen as having built the Kaaba in Mecca, and consequently its sanctuary, which according to the Muslim view is seen as the first mosque that ever existed. According to other scholars, Islam started during the lifetime of Muhammad in the 7th century CE, and so did architectural components such as the mosque. In that case, either the Mosque of the Companions or Quba Mosque would be the first mosque that was built in the history of Islam</p>
    <h2>Era of Muhammad</h2>
    <p>Upon Muhammad's victorious return to Mecca in 630 CE, Ali broke the idols in and around the Kaaba,[25] similar to what, according to the Quran, Abraham did in his homeland. Thus ended polytheistic use of the Kaaba, and began monotheistic rule over it and its sanctuary</p>
