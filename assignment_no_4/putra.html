    <h1><u>Putra Mosque</u></h1>
    <p>The Putra Mosque <b>(Malay: Masjid Putra; Jawi: مسجد ڤوترا)</b> is the principal mosque of Putrajaya, Malaysia.
        Construction of the mosque began in 1997 and was completed two years later.

        It is located on Putra Square and is adjacent to man-made Putrajaya Lake.

        The pink-domed Putra Mosque is constructed with rose-tinted granite and consists of three main functional areas
        – the prayer hall, the Sahn, or courtyard, and various learning facilities and function rooms. The mosque can
        accommodate 15,000 worshippers at any one time.[1]

        On 25 June 1999, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad went to Putra Mosque for prayers
