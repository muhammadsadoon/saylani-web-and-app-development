    <h1><u>Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque</u></h1>
    <p>The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (Arabic:<b> جَامِع ٱلشَّيْخ زَايِد ٱلْكَبِيْر Jāmiʿ</b> Aš-Šaykh Zāyid Al-Kabīr) is
        a mosque located in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. It is the country's largest mosque,
        and is the key place of worship for daily Islamic prayers. There is a smaller replica of this mosque in
        Surakarta, a city in Indonesia. The late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan built this mosque to convey historic
        consequence and to embody the Islamic message of peace, tolerance and diversity.</p><br><br><br>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Grand Mosque was constructed between 1994 and 2007 and was inaugurated in December 2007. The building complex
        measures approximately 290 by 420 m (950 by 1,380 ft), covering an area of more than 12 hectares (30 acres),
        excluding exterior landscaping and vehicle parking. The main axis of the building is rotated about 12° south of
        true west, aligning it in the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.The project was launched by the late
        president of the U.A.E., Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who wanted to establish a structure that would unite
        the cultural diversity of the Islamic world with the historical and modern values of architecture and art. In
        2004, Sheikh Zayed died and was buried in the courtyard of the mosque.

        Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center (SZGMC) offices are located in the west minarets. SZGMC manages the day-to-day
        operations and serves as a center of learning and discovery through its educational cultural activities and
        visitor programs. The library, located in the northeast minaret, serves the community with classic books and
        publications addressing a range of Islamic subjects: sciences, civilization, calligraphy, the arts, and coins,
        including some rare publications. The collection comprises material in a broad range of languages, including
        Arabic, English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Korean. For two years running, it was voted the world's
        second favourite landmark by TripAdvisor.

        The Grand Mosque has been a significant destination for visiting foreign leaders during official state visits to
        the UAE. Notable visitors include, the then US Vice President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

    <h2>Design and construction</h2>
    <p>The mosque was built under the guidance and supervision of Sheikh Zayed, who was buried here after his death in
        2004. It features 82 domes, more than 1,000 columns, 24-carat-gold gilded chandeliers and the world's largest
        hand-knotted carpet. The main prayer hall is dominated by one of the largest chandeliers. The mosque was
        designed under the management of the Syrian architect Youssef Abdelke, and three other architectural designers
        from Syria who completed the design and worked on developing it, Basem Barghouti, Moataz Al-Halabi, and Imad
        Malas.The mosque's architect Yusef Abdelki took inspiration from a number of sources: the Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi
        Mosque in Alexandria, designed by Mario Rossi in the 1920s;[9] the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan;[10] and
        other references of Persian, Mughal, and Indo-Islamic architecture. The dome layout and floorplan of the mosque
        was inspired by the Badshahi Mosque. Its archways are quintessentially Moorish, and its minarets classically
        Arab.

        In a joint-venture between Italian contractors Impregilo and Rizzani de Eccher, more than 3,000 workers and 38
        sub-contracting companies were conscripted in its construction. The mosque was completed under a second contract
        by a Joint Venture between ACC and Six Construct (part of Belgian company BESIX Group) between 2004 and
        2007.[11][12][13] Natural materials were chosen for much of its design and construction due to their
        long-lasting qualities, including marble stone, gold, semi-precious stones, crystals and ceramics. Artisans and
        materials came from many countries including Syria, especially from Damascus and Aleppo, and some other
        countries such as India, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, China, United Kingdom, New Zealand,
        North Macedonia and the U.A.E.[citation needed] The intricate flower mosaics decorating the courtyard was
        designed by the British artist Kevin Dean, who embraced Sheikh Zayed’s passionate vision to create a mosque that
        unites the world, as he chose flowers from the Middle East, such as Tulips, Lilys, and Irises. As inlays of
        colored marble form exuberant floral patterns that curl and twist gracefully from the edges towards the center
        adorn the courtyard. While the rest of the Sahan was inlaid with thousands of small pieces of white marble.</p>
