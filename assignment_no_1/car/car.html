		<h1>Intro for car models</h1>
		<p><b>Car models</b> have evolved significantly over the years, from the early Ford Model T, which made cars affordable for the masses, to the sleek, performance-driven models of the 1950<sub>s</sub> and 1960<sub>s</sub> like the Chevrolet Corvette. Over time, safety features, fuel efficiency, and technological advancements became central to car designs. In recent decades, the shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) like the <b>Tesla</b> Model S highlights growing environmental concerns. Today's car models are not just about transportation; they incorporate cutting-edge technology like autonomous driving and advanced infotainment systems. The future of car models lies in sustainability, innovation, and smart connectivity, shaping the way we drive and live.</p>
